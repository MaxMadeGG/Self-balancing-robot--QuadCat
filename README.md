# Self-balancing robot- QuadCat

Wheel-legged balancing robot. Two gimbal motors drive the wheels with my own FOC code, two servos move the legs so it can crouch, and an MPU-6050 is used for balancing.

Still work in progress. For now this is mostly the electronics and PCB, the rest will come later.

## Parts

| Part | Notes |
|---|---|
| ESP32 NodeMCU-32S | 30 pin |
| 2x SimpleFOC Mini (DRV8313) | needs at least 8 V |
| 2x gimbal motor | 7 pole pairs, ~35 Ω |
| 2x AS5600 | encoders, address 0x36 (can't be changed) |
| MPU-6050 | 0x68 |
| 2x MG90S | leg servos |
| 2x VL53L0X | distance sensors, not tested yet on the v2.0 |
| 2S LiPo 2600 mAh | |
| XL6009 boost | 10 V for the drivers |
| Buck converter | 5 V for the ESP32 and servos |
| 2x 220 µF cap | one on each driver, needed or the ESP32 resets |

## Schematic and PCB

The full schematic and PCB files are in the repo. The encoders both use address 0x36, so each one is on its own I2C bus.
It was made in easyEDA.

## Things to know

- GPIO 5, 12 and 27 need a 10k pulldown to GND. 5 and 12 are strapping pins, and if 12 is high at boot the ESP32 won't boot. Without the pulldown on the EN pins the drivers can turn on by themselves.
- AS5600: the chip has to face the magnet, about 1 mm away and flat. Check the AGC register, around 120-180 is good, 255 means too far.
- Reading the MPU at 2 kHz on the same bus as an encoder didn't work. 200 Hz is fine.
- Trim the header pins! Two pins touched on a driver (EN and nFAULT), the driver stayed on all the time and it killed an ESP32.

## Problems I had

Board v1:
- only one GND pin was really connected, it worked on USB but not on battery
- broken trace to SV2
- the two I2C buses were merged, so both encoders answered on 0x36 (couldn't fix)
- no caps on the drivers, the ESP32 reset during calibration
- encoder cables crossed and encoder direction inverted (fixed in code)
> **Note:** These v1 issues have all been resolved in the v2 layout included in this repository.

Board v2:
- motor 1 IN3 and EN were swapped in my code, so motor 1 only twitched. Took a while to find...
- SV2 is on GPIO12, not 13
- encoders were mounted the wrong way and too far from the magnet

## Software

I don't use the SimpleFOC library. On my board it didn't output any PWM, so I wrote my own FOC using ledcWrite. The servos also use ledcWrite directly instead of ESP32Servo, so they don't fight with the motors over timers.

The control loop runs at a fixed 2 kHz. More about the code later.

## To do

- [ ] pulldowns on 5, 12 and 27
- [ ] test the lasers and battery reading
- [ ] finish the body
- [ ] balance loop
- [ ] ESP-NOW remote - connect to Kode dot and the Pinetime watch to control the robot by yourself
- [ ] make the robot autonomous

## Mechanical

Coming later...
You can still make your own robot with this working PCB, you will just need to tune the code (me i can't due to the ESP32 that broke)
